\section{Materials}

\subsection{Plastic}
PLA and ABS are 2 of the most common FDM (Fused deposition modeling) desktop printing materials.
Both materials are thermoplastics, meaning they become pliable or moldable at a certain elevated temperature and solidifies upon cooling.
Via the FDM process, both materials are melted and then extruded trough a nozzle to build up the layers that create a final part.
\\ \\
Table \ref{tab:pla-abs} below compares the main properties between PLA \& ABS:

    \end{threeparttable}    
\end{table}

\subsection{Silicone}
Silicone is a dynamic material that moves with the body while simultaneously offering 
an enhanced grip on the residual limb and improved suspension of the prosthesis.
Silicone is mostly used in realistic looking prosthetics and for mold making.
\\ \\ 
Table \ref{tab:silicone-properties} below gives the main properties of silicone:

    \end{threeparttable}    
\end{table}

\subsection{Carbon Fiber}
Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), is an extremely strong and light fiber-reinforced plastic which contains carbon fibers.
Carbon fiber is often used in prosthetics, sports equipment, aerospace and wherever the high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness from carbon fiber are required.
CFRPs are composite materials.
In this case the composite consists of two parts: a matrix and a reinforcement.
In this case the reinforcement is carbon fiber, which provides the strength.
The matix is usually a polymer resin, such as epoxy, to bind the reinforcements together.
This makes the material properties depend on those distinct elements.

\subsection{Metal}
Alloys containing titanium are known for their high strength, lightweight, and exceptional corrosion resistance.
Despite being as strong as steel, titanium is about 40\% lighter in weight.
Titanium is also formidable in its resistance to corrosion by both water and chemical media.
\\
Because titanium has a low modulus of elasticity that means titanium is not also very flexible, but returns to its original shape after bending.
\\ \\
Aluminium is a very light metal with a specific weigt of $2.7 g/cm^3$, about a third that of steel.
Its strength can be adapted to the apllication required by modifying the composition of its alloys.
Aluminium naturally generates a protective oxide coating and is highly corrosion resistant which can be further imporeved by different types of surface treatments. 
This is particularly usefull for applications where protection and conservation are required.
